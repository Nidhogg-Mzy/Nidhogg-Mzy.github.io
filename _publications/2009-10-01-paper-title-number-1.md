title: "Prompt2NeRF-PIL: Fast NeRF Generation via Pretrained Implicit Latent"
collection: publications
permalink: 'https://prompt2nerf-pil.github.io/'
excerpt: 'This paper explores promptable NeRF generation (e.g., text prompt or single image prompt) for direct conditioning and fast generation of NeRF parameters for the underlying 3D scenes, thus undoing complex intermediate steps while providing full 3D generation with conditional control. Unlike previous diffusion-CLIP-based pipelines that involve tedious per-prompt optimizations, Prompt2NeRF-PIL is capable of generating a variety of 3D objects with a single forward pass, leveraging a pre-trained implicit latent space of NeRF parameters. Furthermore, in zero-shot tasks, our experiments demonstrate that the NeRFs produced by our method serve as semantically informative initializations, significantly accelerating the inference process of existing prompt-to-NeRF methods. Specifically, we will show that our approach speeds up the text-to-NeRF model DreamFusion and the 3D reconstruction speed of the image-to-NeRF method Zero-1-to-3 by 3 to 5 times.
